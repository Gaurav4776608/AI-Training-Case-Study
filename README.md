📌 Customer Churn Prediction System
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🚀 Project Overview

Built a machine learning model to predict whether a telecom customer will churn or not.
Implemented using Logistic Regression for binary classification.
Developed an interactive web application using Streamlit.
Users can input customer details and get real-time churn probability.
Designed to simulate a real-world telecom customer retention analytics system.

🤖 Model & Approach
🔹 Model Used:
Logistic Regression

🔹 Why Logistic Regression?
Best suited for binary classification problems
Outputs churn probability (0–100%)
Provides interpretable feature coefficients
Computationally efficient and fast

🔹 Training Process:
Split dataset into training and testing sets
Trained Logistic Regression model on training data
Evaluated performance using test data
Saved trained model using Pickle
Integrated model into Streamlit for deployment
